# Heart Disease Data Analysis

Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of deaths globally. To identify the causes and develop a system to predict potential heart attacks in an effective manner is necessary. The data presented has all the information about relevant factors that might have an impact on cardiovascular health. The data needs to be studied in detail for further analysis.

# Objective: 

To analyze the dataset that will help to create a model that will predict the heart disease based on various input features
